<h1>PREFACE</h1>
<P CLASS='FIRST'>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There seems to be no general agreement as to what should constitute a first course in
    calculus and analytic geometry. Some people insist that the only way to really understand
    calculus is to start off with a thorough treatment of the real-number system and develop
    the subject step by step in a logical and rigorous fashion. Others argue that calculus is
    primarily a tool for engineers and physicists; they believe the course should stress applications of the calculus by appeal to intuition and by extensive drill on problems which develop
    manipulative skills.<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; There is much that is sound in both these points of view. Calculus is
    a deductive science and a branch of pure mathematics. At the same time, it is very important to remember that calculus has strong roots in physical problems and that it derives
    much of its power&nbsp; and beauty from the variety of its applications. It is possible to combine
    a strong theoretical development with sound training in technique; this book represents
    an attempt to strike a sensible balance between the two. While treating the calculus as a
    deductive science, the book does not neglect applications to physical problems. Proofs of
    a11 the important theorems are presented as an essential part of the growth of mathematical
    ideas; the proofs are often preceded by a geometric or intuitive discussion to give the
    student some insight into why they take a particular form. Although these intuitive discussions Will satisfy readers who are not interested in detailed proofs, the complete proofs
    are also included for those who prefer a more rigorous presentation.
    The approach in this book has been suggested by the historical and philosophical development of calculus and analytic geometry. For example, integration is treated before
    differentiation. Although to some this may seem unusual, it is historically correct and
    pedagogically sound. Moreover, it is the best way to make meaningful the true connection
    between the integral and the derivative.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
    The concept of the integral is defined first for step functions. Since the integral of a step
    function is merely a finite sum, integration theory in this case is extremely simple. As the
    student learns the properties of the integral for step functions, he gains experience in the
    use of the summation notation and at the same time becomes familiar with the notation
    for integrals. This sets the stage SO that the transition from step functions to more general
    functions seems easy and natural.

    <H2 id="Section2">PREFACE TO THE 2ND EDITION</H2>
    <P class="SECOND">The second edition differs from the first in many respects. Linear algebra has been
        incorporated, the mean-value theorems and routine applications of calculus are introduced
        at an earlier stage, and many new and easier exercises have been added. A glance at the
        table of contents reveals that the book has been divided into smaller chapters, each centering
        on an important concept. Several sections have been rewritten and reorganized to provide
        better motivation and to improve the flow of ideas.
        As in the first edition, a historical introduction precedes each important new concept,
        tracing its development from an early intuitive physical notion to its precise mathematical
        formulation. The student is told something of the struggles of the past and of the triumphs
        of the men who contributed most to the subject. Thus the student becomes an active
        participant in the evolution of ideas rather than a passive observer of results.
        The second edition, like the first, is divided into two volumes. The first two thirds of
        Volume 1 deals with the calculus of functions of one variable, including infinite series and
        an introduction to differential equations. The last third of Volume 1 introduces linear
        algebra with applications to geometry and analysis. Much of this material leans heavily
        on the calculus for examples that illustrate the general theory. It provides a natural
        blending of algebra and analysis and helps pave the way for the transition from onevariable calculus to multivariable calculus, discussed in Volume II. Further development
        of linear algebra Will occur as needed in the second edition of Volume II.
        Once again 1 acknowledge with pleasure my debt to Professors H. F. Bohnenblust,
        A. Erd√©lyi, F. B. Fuller, K. Hoffman, G. Springer, and H. S. Zuckerman. Their influence
        on the first edition continued into the second. In preparing the second edition, 1 received
        additional help from Professor Basil Gordon, who suggested many improvements. Thanks
        are also due George Springer and William P. Ziemer, who read the final draft. The staff
        of the Blaisdell Publishing Company has, as always, been helpful; 1 appreciate their sympathetic consideration of my wishes concerning format and typography.
        Finally, it gives me special pleasure to express my gratitude to my wife for the many ways
        she has contributed during the preparation of both editions. In grateful acknowledgment</P>
